# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of the Event Planning App I made was to allow a user to login, write, read, update, and delete from a database. Also have a way to notify them of events through SMS messaging. The app was designed to address the need to keep reminders to events all in one place.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A login screen, a home page screen with list of events, FAB button and settings button, a settings page for SMS privileges, and a create/edit page for the events. My UI designs made sure that the app flowed and meshed well. Also making sure that I had all the buttons I needed so that the user could use the app correctly such as, FAB to edit create events, delete button, SMS switch, and login and sign-up button.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the coding of designing my app in segments. First, I coded the login screen, then the home page screen and create/edit event screen then last was the SMS/settings screen. I wanted to do it in pieces because coding everything at once would not have a great plan. It would have become very complicated and I possibly would not have finished.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The way I tested my code was by functional testing and acceptance testing. It was very important because if I had not done these types of testing, I probably would have submitted something that would not have worked.  

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The only place I had to innovate was the SQLite CRUD. I was not very familiar with making a CRUD so figuring out what I needed and how to implement this was hard. This was my biggest obstacle in the project.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the best thing of the entire app was the CRUD that I implemented and how I made it user interactable. When I accomplished this, it made my project seem legit. There are some problems with everything but all in all it seemed like a solid first app.
